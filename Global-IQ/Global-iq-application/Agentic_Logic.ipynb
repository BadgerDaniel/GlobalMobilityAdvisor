        "**Summary of Routing Agent Testing & Conclusions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Iterative Dataset Creation & Multi-LLM Evaluation:**\n",
        "    * A synthetic test dataset, ultimately comprising 90 queries, was developed through an iterative process.\n",
        "    * Initial dataset generation involved prompting an advanced AI (like ChatGPT, using a template refined with Gemini's input) to create queries and initial labels across five distinct routing categories.\n",
        "    * This dataset underwent a \"triangulation\" review where a second LLM (Gemini, in our interactions) evaluated the AI-generated labels to enhance their quality and appropriateness, prior to final human acceptance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent Evaluation and Ground Truth Refinement:**\n",
        "    * The project's routing agent, powered by the `gpt-4o` model, was tasked with classifying the queries from this refined synthetic dataset.\n",
        "    * The agent's predictions were initially compared against the dataset's labels, yielding a preliminary accuracy score.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Human-in-the-Loop Adjudication and Revised Accuracy:**\n",
        "    * The initial automated test resulted in a routing accuracy of 81.11% (73 out of 90 correctly routed).\n",
        "    * A human review of the 17 \"misclassified\" queries was conducted. This review revealed that in a significant number of these cases (9 out of 17), the routing agent’s decision was deemed more contextually appropriate or nuanced than the initial synthetic label.\n",
        "    * By adjusting the \"ground truth\" to reflect these more accurate interpretations (effectively siding with the agent's output as adjudicated by human judgment), the effective accuracy of the routing agent was recalculated to **approximately 91.11%**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Conclusions on Current Approach & Validation:**\n",
        "    * The current routing agent demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of query intent, sometimes surpassing the quality of purely synthetically generated labels, especially for nuanced queries.\n",
        "    * Simply creating a larger volume of synthetic data using the same generation methods may not yield substantial improvements at this stage; the quality of labels is paramount.\n",
        "    * The process of using multiple LLMs for generation and review, combined with human oversight (LLM Triangulation), has been effective in validating the agent's core routing logic and demonstrating a high level of performance (over 90% effective accuracy).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Proposed Next Steps:**\n",
        "    * **Sponsor Engagement:** Present the current 90-query dataset and the routing agent's classifications to the project sponsor for expert domain validation and to align on the desired routing for ambiguous cases.\n",
        "    * **Edge Case Generation:** Collaborate with the sponsor to identify and formulate more complex or specific edge-case queries that reflect real-world challenges in global mobility, further testing the agent's robustness.\n",
        "    * **Future Enhancements:** Recognize that while the current off-the-shelf advanced LLMs provide excellent baseline routing, achieving further significant gains, especially on highly specialized or ambiguous domain-specific queries, might involve deeper integration of sponsor-provided expert knowledge, more targeted prompt engineering based on sponsor feedback, or potentially exploring fine-tuning options if deemed necessary."
